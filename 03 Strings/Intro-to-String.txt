String is a data type in python. 

String is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. 
We can primarily write a string in these three ways. 

a ='chandni'       # Single quoted string 
b = "chandni"      # Double quoted string 
c = '''chandni'''  # Triple quoted string 

String slicing

String slicing means extracting a part of a string.

string[start : end]
Example:
str = "chandni"
print(str[0:5])   # chand
print(str[2:])    # andni
print(str[:4])    # chan
print(str[-3:])   # dni     
                                         
STRING FUNCTIONS 

Some of the commonly used functions to perform operations on or manipulate strings 
are as follows. Let us assume there is a string ‘str’ as follows: 
str = 'chandni' 

Now when operated on this string ‘str’, these functions do the following: 

1. len () function: – This function returns the length of the strings. 
str = "chandni" 
print(len(str))  # Output: 7 

2. String.endswith("dni"): – This function_ tells whether the variable string ends with 
the string "dni" or not. If string is "chandni", it returns true for "dni" since Chandni ends 
with dni. 

str = "chandni" 
print(str.endswith("dni"))  # Output: True 

3. string.count("c"): – counts the total number of occurrences of any character. 

str = "chandni" 
count = str.count("n") 
print(count)  # Output: 2 

4. the first character of a given string. 

str = "chandni" 
capitalized_string = str.capitalize() 
print(capitalized_string)  # Output: "Chandni" 

5. string.find(word): – This function friends a word and returns the index of first 
occurrence of that word in the string. 
str = "chandni" 

index = str.find("n") 
print(index)  # Output: 3 

6. string.replace (old word, new word ): – This function replace the old word with 
new word in the entire string. 

str = "maya" 
replaced_string = str.replace("m", "r") 
print(replaced_string)  # Output: "raya"
