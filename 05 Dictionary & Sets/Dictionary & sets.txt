Dictionary is a collection of keys-value pairs.

Syntax:
    a = {
        "key": "value",
        "chandni": "code",
        "marks": "100",
        "list": [1, 2, 9]
    }

print(a["key"]) # Output: "value"
print(a["list"]) # Output: [1, 2, 9]

PROPERTIES OF PYTHON DICTIONARIES:
                                1. It is unordered.
                                2. It is mutable.
                                3. It is indexed.
                                4. Cannot contain duplicate keys.

DICTIONARY METHODS:
                Consider the following dictionary.
                a={"name":"chandni"
                "from":"india"
                "marks":[92,98,96]}

• a.items(): Returns a list of (key,value)tuples.
• a.keys(): Returns a list containing dictionary's keys.
• a.update({"friends":}): Updates the dictionary with supplied key-value pairs.
• a.get("name"): Returns the value of the specified keys (and value is returned
eg."chandni" is returned here).

SETS IN PYTHON.

Set is a collection of non-repetitive elements.

s = set() # no repetition allowed!
s.add(1)
s.add(2) # or set ={1,2}

If you are a programming beginner without much knowledge of mathematical
operations on sets, you can simply look at sets in python as data types containing
unique values.

PROPERTIES OF SETS:
                1. Sets are unordered => Element’s order doesn’t matter
                2. Sets are unindexed => Cannot access elements by index
                3. There is no way to change items in sets.
                4. Sets cannot contain duplicate values.

OPERATIONS ON SETS:
                Consider the following set:
                s = {1,8,2,3}
                
• len(s): Returns 4, the length of the set
• s.remove(8): Updates the set s and removes 8 from s.
• s.pop(): Removes an arbitrary element from the set and return the element
removed.
• s.clear():empties the set s.
• s.union({8,11}): Returns a new set with all items from both sets. {1,8,2,3,11}.
• s.intersection({8,11}): Return a set which contains only item in both sets {8}.
