                                    CHAPTER 2 – VARIABLES AND DATATYPE 

A variable is the name given to a memory location in a program. For example. 

a= 30      (variables = container to store a value.) 
b= "Chandni"  (keywords = reserved words in python.)  
c= 71.22  (identifiers = class/function/variable name) 


DATA TYPES:-

Primarily these are the following data types in Python:-

1. Integers 
2. Floating point numbers 
3. Strings 
4. Booleans  
5. None 

Python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the type of data for us.

a= 71      (identifies a as class <int>)
b=88.44       (identifies b as class <float>) 
name= "Chandni"   (identifies name as class <str>)
